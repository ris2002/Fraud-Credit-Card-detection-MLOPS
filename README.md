# Fraud-Credit-Card-detection-MLOPS
Some architectural ideas and workflow patterns are adapted from my earlier project:
E-mail Spam Detection — MLOps-(Link: https://github.com/ris2002/E-mail-Spam-MLOPS-.git).
## Different thinngs to be done wrt to my 3rd Project
* Involving a feature store.
* In previous project I have construted pipeline immediately. This thimee I am going run the project without pipeline first and only after that I am going to create DAGS and Tasks.
* Usage of terraform
